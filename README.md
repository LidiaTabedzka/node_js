# node_js
Task within Kodilla bootcamp. The aim was to use Node.js in my projects for the first time.

There were 6 Tasks - a new branch on each was created. 

Branch Task1 - installing Node.js and creating a simple app using process.stdin, stdout and stderr. 

Branch Task2 - creating a simple app using Node and own modules. 

Branch Task3 - creating a simple app using npm modules. 

Branch Task4 - creating a simple app using fs module - reading and writing files. 

Branch Task5 - creating a simple app using http module - serving static files. 

Branch Task6 - creating a website for uploading files (and displaying them after upload).
